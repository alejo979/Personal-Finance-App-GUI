Personal Finance App for tracking Income and Expenses

This is the Graphical User Interface, where I implemented a personal finance app which helps tracking personal income and expenses. As an initial step, few initial features have been implemented. Data is stored in a database (SQLite)

Create or Access and existing account
2 internal sub-accounts: Card and Cash
Type of transactions: Income, Expense, Transfer (only transfers from card to cash implemented, within same account)
View all transactions
View filtered transactions by date & either type of transaction

This is my very first larger project, which I fully enjoyed. I know there are several things to be refined and to be more 'pythonic', which will come in time, but wanted to share with the community.

If you have any comments or feedback, they are fully welcome.
